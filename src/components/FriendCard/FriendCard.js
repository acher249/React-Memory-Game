    TO DO:
    - steal this onclick method below.. but put the onlick over the entire card.
    - need the new logic for the memory game. figure out the best place to put it.
    - get an array of all the friends, out of the json file.
    - when the game starts create a new array with the friends that you have clicked with a counter for how many
    you have gotten in a row. then if the user clicks the same character that they have aleady clicked, 
    ie. is inside the array, then they lose. give them a prompt top start over.
